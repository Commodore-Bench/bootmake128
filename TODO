add fn to allocate boot sector without writing it!
	(for use after VALIDATE)
add fn: "load boot sector"
add fn: "load from file"
add fn: "save to file"
in addition to DLOAD and RUN, add GO64+LOAD (and maybe even BURSTLOAD-GO64-RUN)

add data for c64 programs: RAM BANK to run in, command to send to disc
	(nothing, u0>m0 or u0>m1)

grey out useless data (c64 stuff when program type is c128)

replace input() with something better
